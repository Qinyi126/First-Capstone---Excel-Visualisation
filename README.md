This dataset provides an in-depth look into the global CO2 emissions at the country-level across 10 years. It helps us to have a better understanding of how much each country contributes to global warming. It contains information on total emissions as well as the emissions from coal, oil, gas, cement production and flaring, and other sources. The data also provides a breakdown of per capita CO2 emissions per country. 

The purpose of the analysis is:
- to track which countries are leading in pollution levels and identify the potential areas where reduction efforts should be concentrated.
- to facilitate research and implement suitable regulations to migitate and lower CO2 emissions for sustainable developments. 
- to study the trend over the years and understand whether the strategies and regulations are effective in bringing down the CO2 emissions.
- to track the countries' progress in meeting CO2 emission targets and adjust their regulations accordingly in order to help the countries to reach their targets more quickly.

# How I have turned the dataset into data visualisation
- Used power query to clean the data and removed duplicates and empty cells, 
- Created pivot tables and 
- Created pivot charts such as line charts, map chart, bar chart and pie chart
- Formatted the charts by changing the background color and the border of the chart
- Formatted the axis of the charts
- Added chart label and data label
- Added slicers to make the charts more interactive

# What have I learnt from this analysis?
- Based on map chart - China has the highest emission of CO2. 
- Based on 10 year analysis - China is increasing at a rapid rate over the years while emissions for other countries are declining.
- Based on pie chart and bar chart for the sources of CO2 - Coal is the main source of the pollution, producing the highest CO2 out of the other sources (i.e. oil, gas, cement, flaring and others)
- Based on chart for emission per capita, Qatar has the highest CO2 emissions.

From the analysis, we can make several assumptions why China has the highest CO2 emissions: 

- Largest producer and consumer of coal and China primarily uses coal to generate electricity 
- Rapid industrialisation during the past 10 years which results in high consumption of energy
- Rapid economy development has changed the lifestyles and energy needs of hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens which leads to increasing growth of CO2 emissions
-  Lack of government initiatives to invest and monitor the development for a greener energy and a more sustainable production method. 
- Companies nor the government are committed to change their approaches that could reduce their emission level such as renewable energy or a more energy efficient system.

For the analysis on emission per capita, Qatar has the highest CO2 emissions:
- It is the largest oil and gas producer. 
- They have relatively small population
